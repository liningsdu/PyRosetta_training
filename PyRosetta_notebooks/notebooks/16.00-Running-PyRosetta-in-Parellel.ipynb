    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebooks contain examples of how to run Rosetta in parellel either locally on a compute cluster through the `pyrosetta.distributed` package that is now included with PyRosetta. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three notebooks contain two high-level examples of parellel PyRosett through a Rosetta-PyData integration using the pyrosetta.distributed namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Chapter 16, Running PyRosetta in Parallel, you will need to use a specific version of PyRosetta that is built for parallelization.**  This is the serialization build.  Besides manually building it from the Rosetta C++ source code, the general way to obtain this is through the use of a `conda` environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `conda` environment is a way to run code that has specific versions of required packages, that instead of being installed globally, will be installed as a local virtual environment that you may run whenever you wish. This is extremely useful when some packages require specific versions of other packages, as is the case for some rosetta distributed code. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to pass the username and password of PyRosetta to conda.  \n",
    "In order to do this, we will create a file in your home directory called `~/.condarc`. The file should look like:"

# PyRosetta Workshops

## Getting Started

### Students

_Step 1:_ Sign in to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive).

_Step 2:_ Make a new folder called “PyRosetta” in your top level directory on Google Drive.
![PyRosetta folder](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Media/PyRosetta-folder.png?raw=true)

_Step 3:_ Get your [PyRosetta license](https://els.comotion.uw.edu/licenses/88).

_Step 4:_ Download the Linux [PyRosetta package](http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow) that is called "Python-3.6.MinSizeRel".
![Linux Download](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/Media/linux-download.png?raw=true)

_Step 5:_ Upload the Linux PyRosetta package (.tar file) to the PyRosetta folder in your Google Drive.

_Step 6:_ Go to https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks and download the ZIP folder.

_Step 7:_ Upload either (or both) the student-notebooks folder and the notebooks folder to the top-level directory of your Google Drive.

_Step 8:_ From the notebooks or student-notebooks folder, open up “01.01-PyRosetta-Google-Drive-Setup.ipynb” in Google Colab by right-clicking, going under “Open With…” and clicking Google Colaboratory.

_Step 9:_ Follow steps to install PyRosetta. You will see a bar and a lot of output, and it should take 10-15 minutes.
Note: You only need to do this once since this installation will be associated with your Google Drive account.

_Step 10:_
Open up “01.02-PyRosetta-Google-Drive-Usage-Example.ipynb” in Colab to make sure that PyRosetta was installed properly. You are now ready to move on to the other notebooks!

### Instructors

_Step 1:_ Please install extensions [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/highlights.html) and [nbpages](https://pypi.org/project/nbpages/).

_Step 2:_ Make any changes to the workshops in the "notebooks" folder. (You can follow the directions for students and edit them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) or on your own computer using a Jupyter Notebooks browser.)

_Step 3:_ When you are done making changes, run make-student-nb.bash to automatically generate the student notebooks in a separate folder, the table of contents you see below, and the keyword index. The student notebooks are copies of the instructor's version that have omitted solutions.
